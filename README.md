# MySK Email Templates

A collection of MJML email templates used by our system to deliver authentication emails to our users. These templates are not directly linked to the services we use to deliver emails.

## Development

- Replicate SK Components as closely as possible, including the palette and fonts.
- Use the MJML VS Code extension (or equivalent) to compile MJML.
- Set the compile destination to inside the `/dist/` folder.
